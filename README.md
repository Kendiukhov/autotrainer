# AutoTrainer Library

## Overview

**AutoTrainer** is a Python library designed to simplify the machine learning workflow by automating the selection of appropriate deep learning models and hyperparameters based on the nature of the input data. It intelligently analyzes the training data provided by the user and selects the best-suited model architecture and training parameters, allowing users to focus on their data without worrying about the complexities of model selection and tuning.

## Features

### Automatic Model Selection
* Detects the task type (e.g., image classification, text classification, regression) and selects the appropriate deep learning model from a comprehensive catalog
* Utilizes advanced heuristics to match data characteristics with optimal model architectures
* Performs preliminary data analysis to determine the most suitable model family

### Hyperparameter Optimization
* Adjusts hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, epochs, and network architecture parameters based on data characteristics
* Implements intelligent search strategies for optimal parameter selection
* Adapts parameters dynamically during training based on performance metrics

### Support for Various Models
* Includes a wide range of models like Transformers, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, feedforward networks, and more
* Provides pre-configured architectures for common tasks
* Ensures compatibility with popular deep learning frameworks

### Customizable Architectures
* Allows users to customize network architectures, including the number of layers and neurons in feedforward networks
* Supports flexible model modification and extension
* Enables fine-tuning of pre-trained models

### Easy-to-Use Interface
* Simple API that requires minimal code to get started with training deep learning models
* Intuitive parameter configuration
* Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Extensible Catalog
* Modular design enables easy addition of new models and architectures
* Plugin system for custom model integration
* Community-contributed model repository

## Installation

To install the **AutoTrainer** library, clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autotrainer.git
cd autotrainer
```
## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Using **AutoTrainer** is straightforward. You only need to provide your training data (X_train, y_train), and the library takes care of the rest.

```python
from autotrainer import AutoTrainer
import numpy as np

# Simulate training data
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 20)  # Features
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Labels for classification

# Initialize AutoTrainer
trainer = AutoTrainer(X_train, y_train)

# Run the training process
trainer.run()
```

### Custom Hyperparameters

You can provide custom hyperparameters to adjust the training process and model architecture.

```python
custom_hyperparameters = {
   'learning_rate': 1e-4,
   'batch_size': 32,
   'epochs': 50,
   'hidden_sizes': [128, 64, 32],  # For feedforward networks
   'activation': 'LeakyReLU',
   'dropout': 0.1,
}
trainer = AutoTrainer(X_train, y_train, custom_hyperparameters=custom_hyperparameters)
trainer.run()
```

### Examples

#### Image Classification
```python
from autotrainer import AutoTrainer
import numpy as np

# Simulate image data
X_train = np.random.rand(5000, 3, 224, 224)  # 5000 images of size 224x224 with 3 channels
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 5000)     # Labels for 10 classes

trainer = AutoTrainer(X_train, y_train)
trainer.run()
```

#### Text Classification
```python
from autotrainer import AutoTrainer

# Sample text data
X_train = [
   "I love this product!",
   "This is the worst service ever.",
   # ... more text samples
]
y_train = [1, 0]  # Binary sentiment labels

trainer = AutoTrainer(X_train, y_train)
trainer.run()
```

Tabular Regression
```python
from autotrainer import AutoTrainer
import numpy as np

# Simulate tabular data
X_train = np.random.rand(2000, 15)  # 2000 samples, 15 features
y_train = np.random.rand(2000)      # Continuous target variable

trainer = AutoTrainer(X_train, y_train)
trainer.run()
```
